Step-1: In step 1 we are reading a file by using file handling read mode.
<br/>

<br/>

Step-3: In step 3 we are doing our main logic ::  
<br/>

1. of all we are taking State_id and age_of_person by user
<br/>

2. Loop through entire list and checking each and every state_id with state code
<br/>

3. If state found then check two condition 
<br/>

A. if(state_code == state_id and age_person >=18 and age_person < 45)
<br/>

B. if(state_code == state_id and age_person >=45 and age_person < 90)
<br/>

4. If condition match than Book NO.of condidates for vaccination and select One of the vaccine
<br/>

B.Covisheld
<br/>
     
5.If the vaccine are in stock than your booking is successful otherwise Vaxin out of stock.
